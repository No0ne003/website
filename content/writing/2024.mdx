As 2024 comes to a close, I wanted to reflect on everything I watched, played, and read throughout the year. It’s been a good year overall; I made significant improvements in front-end development. This year, I learned React and Next.js, and I dove into low-level programming, I also began learning Rust, and I’m excited for what 2025 will bring and what I'll become.
## TV Shows

I didn't watch a lot of series this year
